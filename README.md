# Writing and consuming REST services

This is a 90-minute presentation on the basics of REST services.

It's written in [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). The
service that generates all of the output is written in
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and
[Flask-RESTful](http://flask-restful-cn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The presentation can be run in Docker (`make run`), or viewed at
